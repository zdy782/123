GROVER
===
This is a dump of the GROVER repository (+ a small bugfix [commit](https://github.com/tencent-ailab/grover/issues/8#issuecomment-908864507)).
[link](https://github.com/tencent-ailab/grover) to the original repository.

To setup the environment: `mamba env create` (or `conda env create` if you have a lot of time).

## Pretained Model Download
Download the pretrained models from Tencent and put them into the `data/model` directory.
   - [GROVER<sub>base</sub>](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/ml/ml-data/grover-models/pretrain/grover_base.tar.gz)
   - [GROVER<sub>large</sub>](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/ml/ml-data/grover-models/pretrain/grover_large.tar.gz) 

## Generating the embeddings
In `generate_embeddings.ipynb` there is code that extracts all SMILES from LINCs & trapnell, generates the 
grover embeddings from them and saves them to a DataFrame.
